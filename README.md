# Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Lab Exercises

Welcome to the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** lab exercises repository! This collection includes all my algorithm implementations from the course, written in **C#**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Contents

The repository covers a variety of algorithms and data structures, focusing on efficient implementations and algorithmic principles.

### String Algorithms
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Calculates the minimum number of single-character edits needed to change one string into another.
- **Rabin-Karp**: A pattern-matching algorithm using hashing for fast substring searches.

### Data Structures
- **Binomial Heap**: A heap data structure that supports quick merging of two heaps.
- **B+ Tree**: A self-balancing tree data structure optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Selection Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap.
- **Bucket Sort**: A distribution-based sorting algorithm ideal for uniformly distributed data.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Prim's Algorithm**: An algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, weighted graph.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Language**: C#

## üîç Usage
Each algorithm has been implemented to highlight its core principles and operational efficiency. You can explore each folder to find the corresponding code, explanations, and examples of usage.
